We received this error at the network level:

Common situations why this would fail:
  - you don&apos;t have internet access
  - you forgot to run / boot your web server
  - your web server isn&apos;t accessible
  - you have weird network configuration settings on your computer

Because this error occurred during a `before each` hook we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite: `XFlix`" type="CypressError"><![CDATA[CypressError: `cy.visit()` failed trying to load:
